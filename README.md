NATPAC Automated Travel Data Collector
A Flutter-based mobile application developed for the Smart India Hackathon to automate travel data collection, replacing tedious manual surveys for NATPAC.

📖 Project Description
This project is developed as part of the Smart India Hackathon for the problem statement proposed by NATPAC (National Transportation Planning and Research Centre), Government of Kerala.

Accurate transportation data collection is often a time-consuming and inadequate process when conducted through manual surveys. To solve this challenge, this project introduces a Flutter-based travel tracking mobile application that automatically captures and manages trip-related details.

🎯 Purpose
This app aims to create a seamless, automated, and scalable travel data collection system. By replacing tedious manual surveys, it provides reliable datasets for NATPAC scientists, enabling better transportation planning, policy-making, and decision-making.

✨ Key Features
🚗 Automatic Trip Capture: Automatically records essential trip details such as trip number, origin, destination, time, and mode of travel.

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Accompanying Traveller Log: Ability to record accompanying travellers with user consent.

🤖 Smart Detection & Nudging: The system can auto-detect certain details, while prompting users for any missing information to ensure data completeness.

🔒 Secure Centralized Storage: All trip data is securely stored in a centralized database/server, making it accessible for research and planning.

📊 Reliable Datasets: Provides NATPAC scientists with high-quality, reliable data to analyze and improve transportation planning.

🛠️ Tech Stack
This project is built using a modern technology stack to ensure a robust and scalable solution.

Mobile Framework: Flutter for cross-platform development on Android & iOS.

Backend: A secure backend service (e.g., Firebase, Node.js) for handling data processing and user authentication.

Database: A scalable database (e.g., Firestore, PostgreSQL) for the secure storage of trip data.

Geolocation: Utilizes native GPS and location services for accurately tracking trip origins and destinations.
